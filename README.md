 Wayne's Powershell Portfolio

Included in this project is a GUI for server management, along with the modules required to run it. 

The GUI allows you to:
1. Check Windows Server Backups. 
2. Check Task Scheduler running on a server.
3. Check event logs on each server for critical errors.
4. Get computer inventory and save the output to an Excel file. 
5. Change computer names in Active Directory.
6. Add emails to a Spam Filter.
7. Unlock a user that's locked out of Active Directory.

All outputs land on a textbox within the GUI for visibility.

Please save the files into a folder and add the file paths into each script. Before running the script, check the comments within each script for instructions. 

Using this script will allow for easy server management by performing the most common and critical functions of IT.
